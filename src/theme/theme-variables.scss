 * TaskFlow Theme Variables
 * 
 * This file defines CSS custom properties for the TaskFlow design token system.
 * All variables are prefixed with --taskflow- to avoid conflicts with Bootstrap or other libraries.
 * 
 * These variables are dynamically updated by ThemeService based on user preferences.
 * Do NOT edit this file directly - it's managed by the theme system.
